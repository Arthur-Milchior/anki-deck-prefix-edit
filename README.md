Add-on number 1262882843

Select any number of cards in the card browser and add a prefix to
their deck name, or remove the left-most prefix

To use:

1) Open the card browser
2) Select the desired cards
3) Go to "Edit > Add prefix "/"Remove prefix" or press ctrl+alt+p/ctrl+alt+shift+p

My main goal was: exporting some cards selected in the browser. Adding
a common prefix to all of them allows to use the usual export
procedure. Once inported, I only need to remove the prefix in order
for the card to go back to their deck. It leaves an empty deck
"prefix" which can quickly and easily be removed.
